  <p><strong>Subject: </strong> Appeal to withdraw the tampered approval for the Mega Drinking Water Projects on Kharasrota River to sustain Bhitarkanika Mangrove Ecosystem as per the guidelines of Bhitarkanika Eco-Sensitive Zone (BESZ).&nbsp;</p>
<br>
  <p>To</p>
  <p>The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests</p>
  <p>Department of Forest, Environment &amp; Climate Change Govt of Odisha.</p>
  <p>Subject:‐ Appeal to withdraw the tampered approval for the Mega Drinking Water Projects on Kharasrota River to sustain Bhitarkanika Mangrove Ecosystem as per the guidelines of Bhitarkanika Eco-Sensitive Zone (BESZ).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is in reference to citizens' appeal to withdraw the Mega Drinking Water Projects on Kharasrota River to sustain Bhitarkanika Mangrove Ecosystem.</p>
  <p>The Government of Odisha is constructing Mega Drinking Water Projects on river Kharasrota, a branch of river Brahmani. The site of water extraction i.e. Barunadiha of Rajkanika of Kendrapara, and the treatment plant i.e. Nauhat of Chandbali of Bhadrak are coming under Bhitarkanika Eco-Sensitive Zone as per the gazette notification of the Government of India bearing no. S.O. 1601 (E)dated 16.06.2015. It is unfortunate that a government project has started construction work without prior permission of the Bhitarkanika EcoSensitive Zone Monitoring Committee (BESZMC).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is no clarification as to how such a project will not harm Bhitarkanika and also the health of the Kharasrota river. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orissapost.com/construction-of-mega-drinking-water-project-begins-in-kendrapara-amid-protests-sec-144-imposed-over-100-arrested/">construction</a> work has already been started amidst protests. The project envisages diverting water from the Kharosotra in Kendrapara district to 0.5 million people in the neighboring Bhadrak district but it will have an adverse impact on agriculture in 220 villages situated along the Kharasrota river, as the water will dry up. Approximately 0.4 million people live in these villages spread across the Aul and Rajkanika, Kendrapara.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/protest-against-water-diversion-project-near-bhitarkanika-turns-violent-78440">Environmentalists</a> have warned that the project will cause an &lsquo;ecological disaster&rsquo; in the nearby Bhitarkanika National Park. The salinity level of the water will increase after its diversion from the river. Farmers will be the worst hit as they will not be able to continue irrigation activities smoothly.</p>
  <p>The area&rsquo;s aquatic biodiversity, including fisheries, is likely to face extinction. Moreover, it is illegal for the state government to launch the project without obtaining environmental clearance and without the approval of the National Wildlife Board.</p>
  <p>I humbly request that -</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Immediate directions must be given to postpone the project work until the environment impact assessment on Bhitarkanika &amp; Kharasrota Ecosystem is carried out by an Expert Committee</li>
  <li>Directions must be given to the Chairman &amp; member Secretary of BESZMAC to withdraw the unethical, false resolution to approve the project, signed by persons who are not members of BKESZMC.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A team should be appointed, of nationwide environment experts water resources, Mangrove Ecosystems, and Bhitarkanika National Park to assess the project and its implications.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Anticipating careful consideration of this urgent matter from your end.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A Concerned Citizen&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br/><br /></p>
