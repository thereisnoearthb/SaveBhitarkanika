    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Appeal to withdraw the tampered approval for the Mega Drinking Water Projects on Kharasrota River to sustain Bhitarkanika Mangrove Ecosystem as per guidelines of Bhitarkanika Eco-sensitive Zone (BESZ)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To The PCCF&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;Department of Forest, Environment &amp; Climate Change Govt of Odisha.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This is in reference to citizens&#39; appeal to withdraw the Mega Drinking Water Projects on Kharasrota River to sustain Bhitarkanika Mangrove Ecosystem.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.orissapost.com/construction-of-mega-drinking-water-project-begins-in-kendrapara-amid-protests-sec-144-imposed-over-100-arrested/">construction</a> work has already been started amidst protests on the<u> Kharasrota River at the Barunadhita area , Kendrapara district in Orissa.</u> &nbsp;The project envisages diverting water from the Kharosotra in Kendrapara district to 0.5 million people in the neighboring Bhadrak district but it will have an adverse impact destroying agriculture in 220 villages on the river as it will dry up. Some 0.4 million people live in these villages spread across the Aul and Rajkanika, Kendrapara.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/protest-against-water-diversion-project-near-bhitarkanika-turns-violent-78440">Environmentalists</a> have warned that the project would cause an &lsquo;ecological disaster&rsquo; in the nearby Bhitarkanika National Park. The salinity level will increase after the diversion of the water from the river. Farmers will be the worst sufferers as they will not be able to continue irrigation activities smoothly.</p>

  <p>The area&rsquo;s water-based biodiversity, including fisheries, will face extinction. Moreover, it is illegal for the state government to launch the project without obtaining environmental clearance and without the approval of the National Wildlife Board.</p>

  <p>It is requested that -</p>

  <ol>
  	<li>Immediate direction must be given to postpone the project work till the environment impact assessment by an expert Committee on Bhitarkanika &amp; Kharasrota Ecosystem.</li>
  	<li>Direction must be given to the Chairman &amp; member Secretary of BESZMAC to withdraw that unethical, false resolution signed by persons who are not members of BKESZMC.&nbsp;</li>
  	<li>Appoint a team of nationwide environment experts skilled with water resources, Mangrove Ecosystem, and Bhitarkanika National Park.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>&nbsp;Anticipating careful consideration to the matter from your end.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A Concerned Citizen&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
